# DETR-vs-EfficientDet-A-generalizability-analysis-of-transformer-vs-convolution-based-models-for-object-detection

We investigate the performance of two state-of-the-art object detection paradigms: DETR (transformer-based) and EfficientDet (convolutional neural network-based). We achieve faithful reproduction of the results reported in the DETR and EfficientDet papers on the COCO dataset. Subsequently, we evaluate the generalizability of these pre-trained models on the unseen Pascal VOC dataset and provide a detailed analysis of the results obtained.
